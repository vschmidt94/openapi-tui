# OpenAPI-TUI

OpenAPI-TUI is a terminal user interface (TUI) for interacting with sites that
advertise their API using the OpenAPI specification.

## Work in progress

The project is not functionally complete.

This is a personal project that I am using to improve my Golang skills and also to
explore some of the [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet) libraries.

## Motivation

As I interact with many APIs via their Swagger UIs, I wanted a terminal-friendly way to interact with them.
Also an opportunity to learn more about the OpenAPI specification.
